Ensure that you have met all the requirements before adopting a dog from a shelter:
<ul>
 	<li>One must be over 18 years of age</li>
 	<li>No offence convicted in relation to animal cruelty</li>
 	<li>The dog cannot be used as a commercial guard dog</li>
 	<li>The dog adopted cannot be used as a present for another person without their knowledge</li>
 	<li>The dog must be registered with your local council within a reasonable time (within 3 â€“ 5 months in accordance to Victorian council guidelines)</li>
</ul>
