<p>Moving to a new home might be difficult for the pet. Give your pet time to acclimate to the surroundings. Make sure that you bring the dog straight home for the first time. There is no need of a welcome party. Just restrict the number of members to just the people staying with you. When you arrive home allow the dog to sniff around the backyard and the house on a leash. Take the dog to the designated potty spot and award with a treat for going there.</p>
