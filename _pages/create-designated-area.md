 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">It is important that your pet is confined to a part of your home that is safe for the spending alone time.&nbsp;</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">The designated area must be visible to you so that you can monitor their behaviour for initial period.&nbsp;</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">The place should not be close to balcony. The designated area must have all the utilities.&nbsp;</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a dog kennel which is outside the house, donâ€™t leave your dog out for longer duration as they might feel left out.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

 	<li><b>Dogs consider their human family as their pack and can develop behavioural issue if excluded from interacting with their pack.</b></li>
