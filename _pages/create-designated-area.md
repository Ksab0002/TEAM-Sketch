<ul><li style="list-style-type: none;"><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;">It is important that your pet is confined to a part of your home that is safe for the spending alone time. </li><li style="font-weight: 400;">The designated area must be visible to you so that you can monitor their behaviour for initial period. </li><li style="font-weight: 400;">The place should not be close to balcony. The designated area must have all the utilities. </li><li style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a dog kennel which is outside the house, don’t leave your dog out for longer duration as they might feel left out. </li></ul></li></ul><p> </p><ul><li><b>Dogs consider their human family as their pack and can develop behavioural issue if excluded from interacting with their pack.</b></li></ul><p> </p><p> </p>
