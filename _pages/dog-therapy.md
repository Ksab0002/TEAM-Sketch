<blockquote>Did you know that adopted dogs may have more complications psychologically compared to a normal dog?</blockquote>
Yes, it is your job and responsibility to ensure that they are feeling safe all the time. They would be part of your family once you adopt them. These are some cue signs that you should be able to pick up when they are not feeling behaving the way that they should be:
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Barking / howling when no one is home</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Panting and pacing</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shivering</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Running away to hide in a corner</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Frequent urinating</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Destroying furniture</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Inducing self-harm, excessive licking and chewing</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not eating or drinking</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Inability to settle</p>
You need to be aware of these signs as they may be trying to tell you something. You may have to consider dog therapy sessions or even specialised dog training / socialising activities as a form of treatment that can help them integrate and adapt better. Dog therapy sessions are available
