In the adjacent graph, we can see the comparison between the number of dogs adopted, reclaimed and euthanized for the year 2014- 2017. As you see, the number of dogs adopted haven’t changed much from 2015 to 2017, but there has been an increase in the euthanasia count.

This data is just for one shelter house, Geelong Animal Welfare Society (GAWS). The number of dogs euthanized in Australia each year is alarming. In 2016-2017, 5763 dogs were euthanized by the RSPCA.

These numbers can be reduced if we are responsible for our pets. While looking to adopt a pet, educate yourself about the pet care and arrangements you might need to do. Look at the below sections to get more insights regarding adopting pets in Victoria. Did you know the dog breeds that are most famous in Melbourne?&nbsp;

Most of the pets that come to shelter are either abandoned or abused. This has a great impact on their behaviour and as they spend more time in shelter houses alone in closed rooms their behaviour worsens. As we see in the adjacent chart, the main reason of euthanasia in rescue dogs is their behaviour. This can be avoided if we make sure to adopt a pet and give them the love they deserve. At Patmydog, we encourage international students to be more aware and ready for the responsibilities that comes with pet adoption.

<h6><strong>A Humble Decision with Responsibility&nbsp;</strong></h6>
“There is more than walking into a shelter and bringing them home”

Giving adopted dogs a second chance of love is a great thing to do, but there are many considerations you have to think through. Dogs that are in shelters may have different requirements and need more care. These dogs might be neglected, abused or abandoned by previous owners.

<h6><strong>“What do you need to do when you first get your furry friend?”</strong></h6>
Yes, you finally decided on adopting a dog after days of consideration. Here is what you should be doing, or ensuring once you get your adopted dog home.
<ol>
 	<li>Desexed</li>
 	<li>Microchipped</li>
 	<li>Vaccination</li>
 	<li>Worming</li>
 	<li>Grooming</li>
 	<li>Flea treatment</li>
 	<li>Health and Behaviour checked</li>
</ol>
<u>Identification</u>

ID <strong>must be attached</strong> to your dog when you are out of your home so that they can be identified easily should they escape from your sight. This registration of the microchip with the council would take 6-8 weeks before it goes up to the national database.&nbsp;

** <em>Do remember to enquire your local shelter if they do these arrangements for you, and ask them if there are any health concerns of your pet that you need to look out for. Visit a vet for further assurance should you still worry about the side effects of microchipping implants. </em>
