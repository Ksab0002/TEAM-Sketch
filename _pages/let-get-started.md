 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">In the adjacent graph, we can see the comparison between the number of dogs adopted, reclaimed and euthanized for the year 2014- 2017.&nbsp;</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">As you see, the number of dogs adopted havenâ€™t changed much from 2015 to 2017, but there has been an increase in the euthanasia count.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">This data is just for one shelter house, Geelong Animal Welfare Society (GAWS). The number of dogs euthanized in Australia each year is alarming. In 2016-2017, 5763 dogs were euthanized by the RSPCA.</li>
</ol>
These numbers can be reduced if we are responsible towards our pets. While looking to adopt a pet, educate yourself about the pet care and arrangements you might need to do.

BE READY TO ADOPT
</a>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the pets that come to shelter are either abandoned or abused. This has a great impact on their behaviour and as they spend more time in shelter houses alone in closed rooms their behaviour worsens.&nbsp;</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">As we see in the adjacent chart, the main reason of euthanasia in rescue dogs is their behaviour. This can be avoided if we make sure to adopt a pet and give them the love they deserve.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">At Patmydog, we encourage international students to be more aware and ready for the responsibilities that comes with pet adoption.</li>
