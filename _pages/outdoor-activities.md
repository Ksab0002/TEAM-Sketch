All dogs are natural athletes and it is important that you consider some activities that can keep your dog active. Ensure that you spend some time to do basic activities. This could be done once your dog is well adapted to the new environment.
<h3><strong><u>Exposure</u></strong></h3>

You need to be prepared to do some basic training such as sit, stand, stay and come. They might have been trained previously but may not be sociable. This could be that the previous owner may not have done so. With that said, it is now your responsibility to expose and introduce them to things like:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; New sights

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; New sounds

Additional creatures that are in his/her new environment

Very rarely adopted dogs can assimilate quickly, but if they are of high energy dogs, make sure you have a few itenary planned out to strengthen out the bond and trust.

It is important to also remember that newly adopted dogs maybe afraid of places that are crowded such as dog parks or dog cafes. It is best to slowly let them adapt to places that are crowded over time. ** Try:
<ul>
 	<li>Outdoor dining spots that are dog friendly</li>
 	<li>Long walks just to enjoy the scenery</li>
 	<li>Let your dog indulge in digging</li>
 	<li>Lure Coursing</li>
 	<li>Dog friendly trails and beaches</li>
</ul>
<em>** Understand that some rescue dogs may not be prepared to be on a leash, as they may have trauma and unexplained fears. Always make sure they are always comfortable to be in a leash before bringing them for any outdoor activities</em>
