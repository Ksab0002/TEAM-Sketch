<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Provide the pet with plenty of chew toys that are free of harmful chemicals.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">It not only keeps them occupied but also prevents them from chewing up on other harmful items and ruining household stuff. Toys can help your dog to relax, making them happier.&nbsp;</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Playing with the toys tuckers them out, leaving them with less energy and prevents them from getting into trouble by breaking household stuff.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Toys keeps your pet entertained and they realise that they can have fun wile you are away.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you have all the utilities such as dog leash, dog crate, food dishes, blanket if needed.</li>
</ul>
