<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;">Provide the pet with plenty of chew toys that are free of harmful chemicals.</li><li style="font-weight: 400;">It not only keeps them occupied but also prevents them from chewing up on other harmful items and ruining household stuff. Toys can help your dog to relax, making them happier.Â </li><li>Playing with the toys tuckers them out, leaving them with less energy and prevents them from getting into trouble by breaking household stuff.</li></ul>
