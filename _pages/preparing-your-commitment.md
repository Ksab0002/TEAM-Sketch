		<p>Your commitment towards the dog will impact their entire life, and you should ensure you can provide all of these before you commit to one. The feeling will be different from playing with dogs outside, but these are dogs that will be your family for the rest of their lifespans.</p><p><strong>Ensure you have:</strong></p><h3><strong>Enough to cover costs</strong></h3><p>The cost to cover for a pet will not come in cheap, as there are basic necessities that you need to do. Costs will come in such as food, toys, leash, medical care and also additional equipment like carriers do cost money. It is best to budget out before committing for one</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Time</strong></h3><p>Your lifestyle will send a huge impact. If you are a student, and active in other outdoor activities, make sure you have time to take care of them and not just leave them at home. Dogs can have a lot of psychological fear as well, and they need a lot of other activities just like human beings</p><h3><strong>Space</strong></h3><p>If you are renting a home or sharing a house, it is good to find out if pets are welcomed inside. Some places do not allow pets, and some people are afraid of dogs. What about the size? Is it enough for your dog to move around comfortably? Is there enough space for them when you are not at home?</p><p> </p>
