It is important that you puppy proof your home to ensure the safety of your new friend. The other reason is to prevent your dog from chewing your household items. You must make sure that all the loose wires are taped to baseboards; store household chemicals out of your petâ€™s reach; remove plants, rugs and breakables from the area where the dog will be spending most of its time. This is important because dogs not only chew things but can knock things over or break stuff with their tails.&nbsp;

Few things to keep away from the reach of your pet are:
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Shoes, socks and other garments</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Plants</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Chemicals</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile phones</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Needles and medicines</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Plastic bags</li>
</ul>
